# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
### Josh Winnes
This repository holds notebooks associated with my submissions for the Kaggle competition: *'Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster'*. The goal of this project is to predict whether or not passengers aboard the Titanic survived based on basic information available about them. Since this is a binary classification competition, the models are graded on accuracy. My most recent model had an accuracy score of 0.78229 which was good for 2,969th place out of 61,123 submissions (95th percentile). Below you will find a brief description of each of the files in this repo.
### **`train.csv`**
The training data with the following columns:
### **`test.csv`**
The testing set. The `Survived` column is unavailable since that is what this model is trying to predict.
### `TitanicSurvival.ipynb`
My first notebook which scored 0.78229
